# -Recognition-and-Image-Retrieval
The objective of this part of the assignment is to get started with a Deep Learning framework
and to use it to create object recognition and retrieval systems. The primary goal of the
assignment is to do as well as possible on the image classification problem ( on the Tiny
ImageNet dataset) and on the image retrieval problem ( on the cars 196 dataset) using
convolutional neural networks.
