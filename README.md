# -Recognition-and-Image-Retrieval
The objective of this project is to use a Deep Learning Framwork to create object recognition and retrieval systems. The primary goal of the
project is to do as well as possible on the image classification problem ( on the Tiny
ImageNet dataset) and on the image retrieval problem ( on the cars 196 dataset) using
convolutional neural networks.
